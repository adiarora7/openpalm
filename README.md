# ðŸ‘‹ Open Palm
Open Palm translates hand gestures into computer commands allowing for a touchless user interface.

![Demo of using your hands to move and click]()*Mouse movement & click*

## How it works
![Logic](./assets/logic.png)

1. Webcam (or iPhone camera through continuity camera!) is used for input.
2. Each frame is then processed and checked for 
    - hand presence
    - handedness (left or right)
    - position (for mouse movement)
    - gesture recognition
3. The recognized gestures are then mapped to certain computer commands.(click, scroll, etc.)

Currently supported actions:
- click, scroll up, scroll down, next tab, previous tab, next desktop, previous desktop, close tab

Libraries used: OpenCV, MediaPipe and PyAutoGui
